  ## Description 
  My assignment is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. For this project I am using MongoDB, Express.js, and the native JavaScript 'Date' object to format timestamps.

  When the application is cloned, the user will run the intallation and then start the server with 'node server.js.'
